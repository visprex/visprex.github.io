# Quantify your intuition with linear regression

**Linear Regression** helps you model the linear relationship between a variable of your interest (dependent variable) and a set of explanatory variables (independent variables) that describe the variance in the dependent variable.

### Ordinary Least Squares
When you [load your dataset](../datasets/index.md), the `Data Schema` section describes the data types of your variables as well as the shape of the dataset with the number of rows and columns.

For our modelling purposes, we can consider the number of rows as the number of observations $n$ and the number of columns as the number of variables to choose from for your independent and dependent variables.

A dependent variable can be described as a vector $y$ and 

$$
y_{i} = \beta_{1} x_{i1} + \beta_{2} x_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_{p} x_{ip} + \varepsilon_{i}
$$
